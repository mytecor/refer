> Unlock Meaningful Insights: Effortless Semantic Search Across Your Local Files

`refer` is a command-line tool for semantic search across your local files using embeddings. It allows you to find relevant files based on meaning rather than just keyword matching.

## Features

- Semantic search using text embeddings
- Support for recursive directory scanning
- Support for indexing web pages
- Multiple output formats (file names or full content)
- SQLite-based vector storage for fast similarity search
- Document management (add, remove, reindex)

## Configuration

`refer` can be configured via JSON files loaded in this order:

- `~/.config/refer/config.json`
- `./.refer/config.json`

If both files are present, `./.refer/config.json` is merged over the global config.
By default, the local database is also stored in `./.refer/refer.db`.
The following settings are available:

```json
{
    "embedding_base_url": "http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings",
    "embedding_model": "nomic-embed-text",
    "api_key": "", // Optional API key
    "include": [],
    "exclude": []
}
```

- `embedding_base_url`: The URL of embedding API endpoint
- `embedding_model`: The embedding model to use
- `api_key`: Optional API key for authorization. **It is recommended to pass this via the `REFER_API_KEY` environment variable for better security.**
- `include`: Optional gitignore-style patterns for files to index
- `exclude`: Optional gitignore-style patterns for files or directories to skip

If no config file is present, these default values will be used.
You can also use any provider that supports the OpenAI format for embedding API.

_If both `REFER_API_KEY` environment variable and `api_key` config value is set, the env variable takes precedence._

### Embedding API

The embedding API can be any server that provides an interface compliant with the [OpenAI embeddings specification](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings), such as Ollama or OpenAI.

By default, `refer` is configured to use Ollama, which is recommended since most machines can efficiently run an embedding model without any cost, rate limits, or privacy concerns. For setup instructions, please visit [Ollama](https://ollama.com).

If you'd like to use the OpenAI API instead, configure it with the following settings:

```json
{
    "embedding_base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings",
    "embedding_model": "text-embedding-v1",
    "api_key": "<your openai api key>"
}
```

For other providers, please consult their respective documentation.

## Authorization

You can optionally set the `REFER_API_KEY` environment variable to provide an authorization token for the API. This token will be included in the request header as `Authorization: Bearer $REFER_API_KEY`. If you are using Ollama, you can keep this variable empty.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/meain/refer@latest
```

## Usage

### Adding Content

Add a single file:
```bash
refer add path/to/file.txt
```

Add files recursively from a directory:
```bash
refer add path/to/directory
```

Watch a directory and index new or changed files automatically:
```bash
refer watch
refer watch path/to/directory
```

Add files while respecting gitignore patterns:
```bash
refer add path/to/directory
```

Add a web page:
```bash
refer add https://example.com/page.html
```

### Managing Documents

Show all indexed documents:
```bash
refer show
```

Show specific document details:
```bash
refer show <id>
```

Remove a document:
```bash
refer remove <id>
```

Reindex all documents:
```bash
refer reindex
```

View database statistics:
```bash
refer stats
```

### Searching

Search on input (returns file names and similarity scores):
```bash
refer search "your search query"
```

Search based on stdin
```bash
cat file-name | refer search
echo "output from other command" | refer search
```

Use a different database file:
```bash
refer --database=/path/to/refer.db search "query"
```

Get full content matches:
```bash
refer search "your search query" --format=llm
```

Limit results:
```bash
refer search "your search query" --limit=10
```

Max distance threshold:

``` bash
refer search "your search query" --threshold=20
```

## How it Works

1. When adding files, `refer`:
    - Checks if they are text files
    - Generates embeddings using the nomic-embed-text model
    - Stores the file path, content, and embedding in SQLite

2. When watching a directory, `refer`:
   - Indexes all matching files on startup
   - Watches for file creates, writes, renames, and removals
    - Applies optional `include` and `exclude` config patterns to control what is indexed

3. When searching:
   - Generates an embedding for your search query
   - Uses SQLite's vector similarity search to find matches
   - Returns results sorted by relevance
